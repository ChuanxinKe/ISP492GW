Loughborough university to suspend lectures,fhlrsh,"Dear Students,

I am writing to you to outline significant changes in our approach to Coronavirus. The UK Government has this afternoon announced that it is moving from the ‘Containment’ to the ‘Delay’ phase of its planned response to Coronavirus (COVID-19). 

Please be reassured that we are taking these measures in order to minimise the risk of Coronavirus incidents on campus. There is still just a single confirmed case associated with the University.

In response I have today authorised that we should escalate our actions in line with our pre-prepared plans. These plans will be reviewed and may change in the future. This will alter the way in which we are responding to COVID-19. I have recorded a short message which you can view here. It is important all students read the following advice carefully.

University Teaching

A group led by our Pro Vice-Chancellor for Teaching, Professor Rachel Thomson, has been meeting to put in place appropriate arrangements for the continuity of our activities in the event of the University having to scale back its teaching. 

Teaching will continue as normal until close of play tomorrow, Friday 13th March. From Monday 16th March we shall suspend ‘normal’ lecturing activity. By this we mean a learning activity led by an individual member of staff presenting to a group of students in a lecture theatre setting. We have asked academic colleagues to make best efforts to ensure that instead, lecture material is online within 24 hours of the scheduled session and made available through Learn in the normal way. There will still be opportunities for you to ask teaching staff questions.

In the short term, moving traditional lectures online will free up timetable slots which can be used instead to prioritise activities which are more difficult to replace virtually, such as students undertaking work in laboratories / studios and seminars / interactive discussions, which are still taking place. Please note that the short-term position may change rapidly. 

The Library and other teaching and learning facilities will remain open for the time being. Many rooms normally used for lectures will therefore be available to you as additional study spaces.

We appreciate that you will all be concerned about your studies. Please be reassured that the Pro Vice-Chancellor for Teaching is working very closely with academic colleagues in Schools to ensure that you can all continue with your studies, undertake appropriate assessments and ultimately progress to the next stage of your University career. In particular, for those of you who are in the final year of your degree, we appreciate that this will be a worrying time. Please be reassured that we have a number of mechanisms in place to adjust assessments and moderate marks where it is appropriate to do so. We shall do our best to ensure that students are still able to achieve to their full potential.

If you wish to return home

Specific advice will be issued to Tier 4 visa holders today.

If you wish to return home, then you must let your School know. At this exceptional time, the University will agree to requests to leave early for Easter. You should however keep up with studies as best as you can via the online material we will make available on Learn. I reiterate that you must let us know if you decide to go home before the end of term so that we know who is here and who is not. 

Travel

We strongly discourage you from travelling overseas for any non-essential activity. If you are intending to travel overseas as Easter approaches, we strongly advise that before setting off you look at the travel advice from the Government for the country you intend travelling to. For example, from 11 March people arriving from overseas into Beijing, irrespective of country of origin, must undertake 14 days of self-isolation at their place of residence or centralised quarantine. You should be mindful that the situation in the country you are going to might change at short notice. Please also bear in mind that the University may be unable to effectively intervene or assist you should you become stranded overseas.

If you are already overseas, we advise that you consider returning home now. Please look at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for travel advice about returning to the UK.

Events on campus

We have taken the decision to cancel some large-scale events scheduled on campus. LSU’s FND will be suspended from this Friday and other large events will be suspended from Monday (including Stupid Tuesdays, Hey Ewe and FND). LSU remains open as normal otherwise.

Please follow listings and announcements carefully to stay abreast.

These measures are likely to stay in place until the new term but will be reviewed regularly.

One of the best things we can all do to try and minimise the risk of any infection spreading is to wash your hands regularly, using soap and water. One of my colleagues has produced a short video that shows why handwashing is very effective. If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, throw it in the bin and wash your hands immediately.

We are updating our dedicated website regularly, in line with advice from the NHS, Public Health England and the Government and to reflect any new questions we are being commonly asked. The FAQs will shortly reflect the content of this email. Please do look at the site regularly for the most up to date information.

I conclude by thanking you for your sensible and proportionate approach to the challenges that we are likely to face over the coming days and weeks.

★本公司一直专注于为英国、加拿大、美国、新西兰、澳洲、法国、德国、爱尔兰、意大利等国家各高校留学生办理教育部学历学位认证和留学回国人员证明，在认证业务上开创了良好的市场势头，一直占据了领先的地位，成为无数留学回国人员办理学历学位认证的首选。公司主要业务涉及：国（境）外学历学位认证咨询，留学归国人员证明办理咨询。基于国内鼓励留学生回国就业、创业的政策，以及大批留学生归国立业之大优势。本公司一直朝着智力密集型的方向转型，建立了一个专业化的由归国留学生组成的专业顾问团队为中心，公司核心部分包括：咨询服务部门、营销部门、制作部、顾问团队共同协作的服务体系。

★业务选择办理准则★

一、工作未确定，回国需先给父母、亲戚朋友看下文凭的情况，办理一份就读学校的毕业证文凭即可

二、回国进私企、外企、自己做生意的情况，这些单位是不查询毕业证真伪的，而且国内没有渠道去查询国外文凭的真假，也不需要提供真实教育部认证。鉴于此，办理一份毕业证即可

三、进国企，银行，事业单位，考公务员等等，这些单位是必需要提供真实教育部认证的，办理教育部认证所需资料众多且烦琐，所有材料您都必须提供原件，我们凭借丰富的经验，快捷的绿色通道帮您快速整合材料，让您少走弯路。

★关于教育部学历认证的小知识：

国外学历学位认证，作为留学生回国后就业、落户、升学必须提交的证明材料，国家虽然没有明文的规定，留学生回国后必须办理，属于自愿行为，不强制要求。但是根据国家部委和国务院学位办的相关规定：留服认证是留学生回国报考公务员，进入国家机关、事业单位，高等教育考试，大型外企等入职时必须提供的国外文凭的证明材料，不仅关系着留学生回国后的就业，更是影响着落户、升学，甚至留学生往后申请海外高层次人才科研启动基金的有力凭据。

国外学历学位认证的办理并不难，只要按照要求准备材料，一次性提交材料，很容易通过认证，只是因为认证的时间比较长，所以建议留学生回国后，就应立即着手办理国外学历学位认证。

但是也有一些马虎的童鞋，不小心将认证材料遗失，导致认证受阻。在办理国外学历学位认证时，最好一次性提交材料，以免延误认证时间，如果认证材料遗失，应该如何办理国外学历学位认证呢

如果成绩单遗失，需联系学校补办，办理学国外学历学位认证必须有正式完整的成绩单，如无正式完整成绩单，不能办理。

如果所获学位证书遗失，需联系学校补办，或开具相关证明在该学校学习，并顺利毕业的证明信，如不能出具，不能办理。

如果护照遗失，申请者需提供：申请者亲笔签名的无法提交留学期间护照的情况说明新护照首页或户籍簿。

提醒：

留学生补办留学期间护照有一定的时间限制，根据留服认证的相关规定，护照的补办必须在毕业一年内办理，逾期将不予补办。

再次，慎重提醒各位广大留学生，一定要妥善保管留学期间的一切材料，因为其中任何一样都有可能关系到您回国后的学历认证。如果有遗失的情况自己实在处理不了的，我公司可代为办理！

如果您处于一下几种情况：

1：留学期间由于种种原因没有毕业，无法获得加拿大大学毕业证书。

2：留学生取得学历的学校不被国家教育部认可，因此取得的学历学位也不会被认可。

3：留学生提供的认证材料不真实，不完整（缺少Study Permit和出入境Visa）

4：留学生在加拿大的学习居留时间不符合标准

5：留学生前置学历存在问题，不被教育部认可

6：留学生存在转学分的情况，转学分不被认可。

如果您处于以上几种情况，自己贸然去申请认证,您必然不会被通过，甚至连递交材料都无法完成，教育部留服不会受理。更有甚者，因为您提供假的材料，最后被拉入认证黑名单，以后再想认证，简直是比登天还难了。

"International student. Torn between Loughborough, Exeter and Glasgow for Finance and Ivestment. Could you please help me?",fved3k,"Hello Reddit,

I am an International student currently applying for a Masters program in the UK to study Finance and Investment. I am considering the three options I mentioned in the title with Loughborough being the closest to my heart. The thing is, Glasgow seems to be the most reputable of the three organizations and it just so happens that they have a Masters program that is perfectly curated for the career that I would love to pursue, (Ms in Financial Fund Management). With that said, and having been lurking here during the entire admission process, I learned not to trust the ratings and rather go for student satisfaction surveys, another area in which Loughborough excels. So, with that said, which university would you say is the best for studying Finance in terms of course quality, student life and most importantly employability? 

Every answer is appreciated.",04-05-2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/fved3k/international_student_torn_between_loughborough/,UniUK
MSc Finance in Birmingham or Loughborough,fve92g,"Hey guys,

I have been accepted at both universities for the following programmes:

* MSc Financial Management at Birmingham
* MSc Finance at Loughborough

But, as the programmes are fairly similar, I find it very hard to make the choice and I would appreciate your opinion on the following:

1. Which university do you think has better reputation and is more widely recognised in the UK/Europe? In the context of the business school?
2. In terms of employability, which one would give me a better outlook?
3. Any other impressions regarding each university and the programmes in particular.

My impressions so far:

* The University of Birmingham has better reputation, but Loughborough Unviersity is gaining ground in that regard.
* The fee and studying at Birmingham will be cheaper (and I have the option of applying for an additional £5000 scholarship).
* The programme at Loughborough is a bit more in-depth, while the one at Birmingham has a dissertation component and I am not sure which would be better for me. I suppose the individual research I am going to do for the dissertation has its benefits.
* In terms of employment, the Uni of Birmingham benefits from being in a large city, while Loughborough seems to have better industry links.
* The Uni of Birmingham being part of the Russell Group I assume has its benefit in terms of its reputation with employers.

&#x200B;

My background:  I graduated in BSc Management from Royal Holloway 6 years ago and have  since worked abroad, in Bulgaria, in finance-related fields. My main objective is to finally get my postgraduate degree and look for employment opportunities in the UK and western Europe.",04-05-2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/fve92g/msc_finance_in_birmingham_or_loughborough/,UniUK

The cost of living/tuition fees is not a factor for me. Rather the faculty and employment prospects are more important. I also understand that the programmes at UCL and LSE are not accredited by the BPS, so I'm not sure if that affects anything.",02-18-2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/f5mq8t/ucl_vs_lse_vs_manchester_vs_loughborough/,IOPsychology

"Is Loughborough in the same league as Warwick, Durham or UCL?",ff1vcq,"I am an international student applying for an MSc in Finance and investment in the UK. I really like Loughborough as it way more affordable for me than going to other said universities. The problem is, Loughborough seems to rank very highly in business but when I did more in-depth research I found out that it’s hard to land a job at a major hedge fund or investment bank with a degree from Loughbro as opposed to, say, Warwick or UCL. 

I really believe that it’s gonna be extremely hard for me to jump the extra 10,000£ so my question is, is loughbro worth the 20,000€ I am gonna pay as an international student and is it way behind other top rated Uk universities or is the difference not that big?",03-08-2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/ff1vcq/is_loughborough_in_the_same_league_as_warwick/,UniUK

York or Loughborough for maths,f5c5fg,"Hi, as the title states I'm looking for advice for York or Loughborough to do maths. I'm looking for a course which have quite a few options to do mechanics/physics of maths. Here are my points for each:  


Loughborough (AAA)  
. Close to home (20 minutes)  
. Great course support  
. Impeccable accommodation  
. Good for sport  
. Top student experience and good SU  


York (ABB)  
. Russel group  
. Really far away (two and a half hours)  
. Lower entry requirements  
. Not as good for sport  
. Accommodation is good but not like Loughborough  


However, the course looks more suited to me at York than Loughborough. I've had my heart set on Loughborough for ages now and I prefer everything about it by far, except the most important part of university, the course. It looks like York have a bigger focus on mechanics than Loughborough who seem more into statistics and finance. Does anyone have any opinion on what they would do?

Big Data and Democracy by Timandra Harkness - 6th December 2019  
Refreshments from 6 pm

We hear more and more about the role of data in political campaigning, and how it is transforming democracy. Some see this as a positive tool to help campaigners connect with an electorate who no longer feel loyalty to political parties. Others see it as a pernicious influence, evading traditional regulation and eroding public debate. How do new data-driven techniques work, and how much should we worry about them?

Broadcaster and author of Big Data: Does Size Matter, Timandra Harkness unpacks the history, technology and philosophy of big data-driven democracy, and asks some awkward questions about where it’s taking us.

From all my research into their program, on the surface, it seems like a pretty good program that caters to students of different undergraduate backgrounds who might not have an extensive portfolio like many other universities require.

If it helps for comparison, a similar program I also applied to is Oxford Brookes University's Digital Media Production MSc program.",01-25-2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/etluuk/what_should_i_know_about_loughborough_universitys/,UniUK

5. [Press evaluations](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/general-election/report-3/#section-5)

**Key findings**

* The two main political parties continue to dominate election news reporting across both sectors, but this is most evident in print. In press coverage, Conservatives and Labour account for 82 percent of all politician appearances. This falls to 65 percent in TV news.
* Labour sources overall have featured more frequently overall than Conservatives in TV and press coverage, with the widest disparity found for TV news. But Boris Johnson has cumulatively received marginally more coverage than Jeremy Corbyn in both sectors.
* Conservative party coverage is more ‘presidential’ than Labour’s in both TV and newspapers. Boris Johnson accounts for 56 percent of all Conservative appearances in TV news and 39 percent in the press. In comparison, Jeremy Corbyn accounts for 43 percent of all Labour appearances in TV and 33 percent in the press.
* In TV news, Liberal Democrats have gained 9 percent more coverage than the Brexit party (15 percent versus 6 percent). In newspaper coverage, they are both at 6 percent, with Nigel Farage gaining more mentions than Jo Swinson (4 percent versus 2 percent).
* The SNP and Plaid Cymru have barely registered in national press coverage. The SNP has established a firmer foothold in TV news (6 percent).
* Overall, the dominance of the two parties in 2019 coverage so far has been slightly less than the level found in reporting of the entire 2017 UK campaign. It has, however, been substantially greater than in the 2015 General Election.
* The 2019 press coverage, the two parties account for 82 percent of all politician appearances, compared with 69 percent in 2015 and 84 percent in 2017.
* In 2019 TV news coverage, the two parties account for 66 percent of all politician appearances, compared with 56 percent in 2015 and 67 percent in 2017.
* In TV, all other minor parties share the same level of coverage achieved in 2017, which is down from 2015 levels.
* In the press, coverage of minor parties in 2019 is up on the levels found in 2017 but 5 percent behind the amounts for 2015.
* The degree of emphasis on substantive issues has increased week by week during the campaign. While Electoral Process comprised 40 percent of all coded themes in the first week, it formed only 26 percent of election news issues during the third week of the campaign. The manifesto launches of the major parties have been a factor in this change.
* The decline in Brexit as the dominant substantive policy issue in coverage continues into week 3, reducing from 12.7 percent of all issues in week 2 to 11 percent.
* Accusations concerning anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and Islamophobia in the Conservative Party have contributed to a dual increase in both the ‘Standards/corruption/scandals/sleaze’ category (up to 9 percent) and the ‘Minorities/religion/sexuality’ category (7.2 percent).
* Elsewhere, scrutiny over the public spending claims in the Labour and Conservative party manifestos has seen a rise in the focus on Public Services (6 percent) and Taxation (10.6 percent). Smaller inclines have also occurred in relation to issues such as Housing (2.4 percent) and Social Security (3.0 percent).
* Health/healthcare provision and Business/economy/trade news both receded on the news agenda between the second and third week to 5.8 percent and 6.5 percent respectively.
* Finally, coverage of Environment issues halved to 2 percent of all coded themes. This may change in the aftermath of Thursday’s Channel 4 TV debate on climate change, but so far there is no sign that this is becoming the ‘climate election’ after all.
* The decline in the amount of newspaper coverage of the campaign noted in week 2 has reversed.
* ‘Quality’ newspaper coverage increased by 22 percent in week 3 to approach levels in the first week.
* ‘Red top’ newspaper coverage increased by 35 percent in week 3 and exceeded levels found in week 1.
* The levels of ‘mid-market’ newspaper engagement increased by 2.5 percent in week 3.
* By contrast, aggregate election coverage further reduced in TV news, reducing a further 5 percent in week 3.
* Men have been quoted 3 times as much as women in TV news to date.
* Men have quoted 5 times as much as women in newspaper coverage to date.
* Women featured slightly more frequently than men in the citizen category.
* In 10 out of the remaining 11 categories, male appearances exceeded female appearances. All of these relate to professional rather than personal roles.
* The one exception (‘government sources’) can be discounted as these sources have rarely featured.
* The gender disparity was greatest for ‘Think Tanks’, ‘Unions/ charities/NGOs’, ‘Public sector professionals’ ‘Academics’ and ‘Pollsters’.
* Women have been quoted more than men in only two categories (TV quotation of ‘Citizens’ and newspaper quotation of ‘Business’).
* The main reason for the female majority in press quotation of Business sources was the lengthy interview published in the *Financial Times* on 11 November with Carolyn Fairbairn, Director General of the Confederation of British Industries.
* The very negative initial press treatment of Labour identified in week 1 was sustained in week 2 and increased in week 3.
* Press evaluations of the Conservatives have become slightly less positive, producing a negative result overall in weeks 2 and 3 when coverage is unweighted.
* When coverage is weighted by circulation, the Conservatives’ overall evaluations move into the positive for all 3 weeks. However, levels of positivity are at lower levels in later weeks.
* All the minor parties fluctuate at or just below the ‘break even’ line. These results need to be interpreted in the light of the distributions outlined in Section 1, which show the two main parties have squeezed coverage of the minor parties. They are not being evaluated because they are increasingly struggling to gain coverage.

5. [Prominence of parties](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/general-election/report-4/#section-5)

 **Key findings**

* The most striking finding is the reduced prominence of Brexit as a substantive theme in the fourth week of the campaign - nearly halving its presence from last week (11 percent of all issues in week 3 to 6.7 percent in week 4).
* This may be partly explained by news organisations preparedness to diversify coverage of the campaign away from an issue that dominated the early stages of the election as well as the impact of other important external events such as the terrorist attack and the 70th anniversary NATO summit.
* That said, it also reflects how Brexit has become a more latent than manifest element in some coverage. For example, several Health/ Health service items linked to discussion of hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals (e.g. President Trump’s comments at the start of the NATO summit that the US wants ‘nothing to do with the NHS’). But for such items also to be coded as Brexit-related there had to be a clear and substantial reference made to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Reporting of hypothetical future trading scenarios and their implications for public health provision were insufficient on their own to gain a ‘Brexit’ allocation.
* This growth of more allusive referencing to Brexit shows how the issue has become more of a contextual factor than a focal point of much electoral coverage: at once everywhere yet nowhere.
* Coverage of ‘Business/ Economy/ Trade’ is now the largest substantive policy theme (9.6 percent).
* ‘Health/ Health Care’ is the second most prominent theme at 9.4 percent, reasserting its presence having fallen away in week 3.
* ‘Defence/ security/ terrorism’ received 10 times more coverage in Week 4 than Week 3. This is explained by the terrorist attack in London on Friday and the NATO 70th anniversary summit held in Watford earlier this week.
* These links were often reported as highly contentious. This is demonstrated by the ongoing prominence of issues concerning ‘standards/ corruption/ scandals/ sleaze’ (7.3 percent). In week 3 this category captured the controversy surrounding antisemitism and the Labour party (see also the linked category ‘Minorities/ religion/ sexuality’). These allegations continued into week 4 but were surpassed by criticisms of politicians who allegedly sought to make electoral capital out of the terrorist murders committed on 29 November.
* Coverage of the ‘electoral process’ itself remained at the previous week’s levels (28 percent).
* Taxation coverage reduced sharply in the fourth week (3.5 percent down from 10.6 percent).
* Environment coverage remains low (3.2 percent). This is not to say there has not been a significant amount of environment related coverage during the campaign. The low figure here reflects the fact that many of these items have a global rather than local emphasis and do not specifically refer to the current election campaign.
* The results demonstrate that the two parties have chosen to focus on very different issues during the sample period. Discussion of public services – the 7th most prominent category within the tweet sample – is the only theme for which there is broad parity of emphasis.
* All other thematic categories are dominated by one or the other party. Brexit, taxation, crime/law and order and immigration are the Conservative Party’s key electoral issues, while Labour have chosen to focus on healthcare, business/economy/trade, the environment, social security and housing.
* The media issue agenda in this period in thematic terms was remarkably consistent across the sectors: Brexit, business/economy/trade, taxation, corruption and scandals, and health were all in the top five in each of the four media sectors.
* While the first and third of these issues have been covered heavily by the Conservatives in their Twitter activity, the second and fifth have been covered more consistently by Labour.
* TV coverage has focused far more on Brexit than on any other issue: 20 percent of coded themes have been about Brexit on TV, compared with only between 8 percent and 10 percent of the other top five issues.
* Within print media, the broadsheet press have focused on Brexit and business/economy/trade the most, while the mid-market titles have covered taxation more than other newspaper types and the red tops have focused more heavily on corruption and scandals, and health.
* In proportional terms, TV coverage has therefore tended to align most closely with the Conservatives’ Brexit agenda than the press. This difference may be partly explained by the more limited news space available in TV coverage compared to newspapers.
* Overall, approximately 60 percent of party/leader tweets have promoted the party’s policies, election strategies or leader, while in 31 percent of cases tweets primarily functioned to attack opponents.
* Instances of ‘attack tweets’, show that each party has tended to expend most of their criticism on attacking each other’s party or leader.
* Conservative party/leader tweets have more often attacked Jeremy Corbyn than Labour party/leader tweets have attacked Johnson.
* The Lib Dems and Jo Swinson have received criticism from Labour more often than from the Conservatives while there have also been a small number of Conservative/Johnson tweets attacking the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon.
* Labour have also on several occasions attacked other actors in the election debate, such as Donald Trump.
* The overall high level of negativity towards the Labour Party has remained constant throughout the election campaign, increasing week-by-week. Manifesto and policy announcements have not managed to reverse this trend over the course of the campaign.
* Unweighted coverage of the Conservative Party started off overall as mildly positive but has progressively become more negative over the course of the campaign and increasingly so in the aftermath of the London Bridge terrorist attack. Negative coverage more than doubled in week 4.
* Weighted coverage remains positive for the Conservative Party because of the high circulation of the Sun and Daily Mail, Conservative supporting newspapers.
* It is noteworthy the extent to which this election is presented as a two-horse race between Labour and Conservative parties. Initial more negative coverage of the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats has declined, which might be an indication that they are now seen as increasingly irrelevant for the election outcome.
* The main party leaders continue to dominate coverage of this campaign. Their prominence continues to remain unchallenged for a further week, and Jeremy Corbyn retains his place at the top of the list. But some of the attention paid to the Labour leader, particularly in the print media, continues to be very hostile towards him, his party and their manifesto.
* Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon, respectively the leaders of the next largest parties in electoral and parliamentary terms, continue to be among the most prominent campaigners but are still some way behind their Labour and Conservative rivals.
* John McDonnell has firmly established himself as a constant presence and Labour’s second most prominent campaigner reflecting both the promotion and criticism of his party’s spending plans. Sajid Javid continues to receive some attention but markedly less than his shadow.
* The LibDem and SNP leaders are two of the four women in this week’s Top 10 but, while this may look slightly more diverse than in previous reports, 16 of the Top 20 are male.
* Reflecting the presidential nature of this campaign, Boris Johnson’s controversial strategist Dominic Cummings make his first appearance in the list, relatively high up the list and above every other Conservative, apart from the Prime Minister himself.
* The impact of the televised debates is reflected in the prominence afforded to several participants including Green co-leader Sian Berry, Richard Burgon, Adam Price and Rishi Sunak.
* The prominence of the debate over health and security is reflected in the prominence of campaigners like Matt Hancock, Priti Patel, and John Ashworth. The decline of Brexit related coverage is reflected in Nigel Farage’s decline to near the bottom of the Top 20.
* The two-party squeeze continues into the fourth week in national press coverage, with representatives of the two parties commanding 90 percent of appearances.
* The squeeze is not as tight in television news, with the two parties accounting for 66 percent of coverage.
* There is a remarkable parity in the overall amounts of coverage given to the two main parties and their leaders. In both the press and television coverage, their prominence is almost identical.
* Jo Swinson has dominated the Liberal Democrat’s share of TV coverage, reflecting her appearance in the broadcast debate formats.
* Nicola Sturgeon has continued to maintain her profile in broadcast media terms and is by far and away the face of her party when the SNP is represented on television.
* The Brexit and Green parties have enjoyed some broadcast coverage, benefitting from the exposure that has come courtesy of their participation in the key television debates.
* Other parties including potential power brokers in a hung parliament such as the SNP, DUP and Brexit Party, have received scant print media coverage heading into the closing stages of the election.
* Prominent in the press at the start of the campaign, the Brexit Party is virtually anonymous now.\\

1. [The key issues of the 2019 media campaign](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/general-election/report-5/#section-1)
2. [Newspaper evaluations of the parties](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/general-election/report-5/#section-2)

5. [Campaign communication of parties on Twitter](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/general-election/report-5/#section-5)

 **Key findings**

* Coverage of the electoral process itself was most prominent. This is a recurrent and predictable feature of UK election reporting. Levels of process coverage in 2019 broadly matched those observed by the CRCC in the 2017 General Election.
* As was widely anticipated, Brexit was the most prominent substantive policy issue. In 2019 Brexit gained more prominence than it did in 2017, but not by as much as one might have anticipated (13 percent compared to 11 percent). TV news gave greatest emphasis to this policy issue.
* Aside from Brexit, the clearest difference between news sectors was in coverage of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland’s future role in the United Kingdom. This received some prominence in TV news coverage but barely registered in press terms.
* Elsewhere, there was striking consistency between the two news sectors as to the other main issues.
* The economy, the health service and taxation commanded high levels of coverage.
* One major reason for the relatively high rankings for ‘Standards/ scandals’ and ‘Minorities/ religion’ was the allegations made against the Labour party and its supposed failure to deal with anti-Semitism in its ranks. 
* The environment received more coverage than it did in 2017, but only just (up to 3 percent from 1 percent in 2017). Coverage of the environment may be increasing, but it has yet to be emphasised in party political terms in election coverage.
* Despite Boris Johnson’s controversial comments in the last week about EU migrants who ‘treat the UK as if it’s part of their own country’, coverage of ‘Immigration/ border controls’ was 2 percent down from levels observed in the 2017 General Election.
* Brexit was by far the most dominant issue at critical points of the campaign – its start and end –but in the intervening periods its prominence lessened, to the point in week 4 that it fell behind all other three major policy themes.
* Research has shown that many voters only start paying attention in the last days of an election, so the final rush of Brexit coverage could have been consequential.
* The previous decline of Brexit shows how it became an implicit rather than explicit aspect of coverage. Brexit was still there, but as our analysis shows it had become increasingly part of the background context of the campaign rather than its focal point.
* Health and health care coverage gained its greatest prominence in week 4, receiving slightly lower prominence in week 5.
* The growing and sustained significance of ‘standards/ scandals’ from week 3 onwards was driven initially by anti-Semitic accusations against Labour and then controversy about the Prime Minister’s allegedly uncaring response to a picture of a young child denied an emergency ward bed.
* Even when Brexit was reported, there was a lack of policy focused analysis as to what implementation might mean. This stood in contrast to the detailed appraisals often applied to other manifesto commitments. For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies gained considerable campaign coverage through their analysis of parties’ spending pledges and projections. Fifty three percent of their appearances were linked to taxation related coverage and 46 percent to business and economy coverage. Only 8 percent were connected to Brexit.
* Both measures show Labour have accumulated very high levels of negative press coverage for every week of the campaign.
* The unweighted data shows these amounts have increased weekly and peaked in the final week of the campaign.
* The Conservative party halved its level of negative unweighted coverage in the final week.
* Increased levels of positivity towards the Conservatives in the highest circulation titles in the last week pushed the party’s weighted total above the line.
* All other opposition parties saw increased levels of negative coverage in the final week.
* Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were the dominant figures in an election that was highly personalised around them and their competing political visions. 
* Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell was a clear third in the Top Twenty and was also over twice as prominent as the current postholder Sajid Javid.  This reflected the promotion and scrutiny of Labour’s ambitious infrastructure plans.
* Only five women made the Top Twenty and of these the highest placed Jo Swinson was a distant fourth behind her Conservative and Labour counterparts, and less prominent than the Shadow Chancellor.  The Liberal Democrat leader was only slightly ahead of the Brexit Party’s Nigel Farage who, despite having no representation in the previous parliament, was afforded more attention than SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. 
* The prominence in the Top Ten of both Jonathan Ashworth and Matt Hancock reflects the significant debate over the future of the NHS during the campaign.  Ashworth’s sixth place in this list was also due to his embarrassment following the publication of comments he had made in a private phone conversation. 
* Another notable feature of the Top Twenty were the relatively prominent appearances made by campaigners formerly associated with Labour (ex-ministers and MPs Ian Austin and John Woodcock) and UKIP (Arron Banks) who had switched their support to the Conservatives.  The list also featured two other unelected figures, Len McCluskey and Dominic Cummings, who were influential advisors to the Conservative and Labour leaders respectively.
* One of the consequences of Labour’s defeat on 12 December is a leadership contest for the party. There is already considerable media speculation as to the likely ‘runners and riders’ for this contest. Table 3.2. lists the extent to which potential future party leaders commanded a media presence in the 2019 campaign. 
* The party leaders dominated TV coverage in the last week of the campaign. Boris Johnson accounted for 68 percent of all Conservative appearances and Jeremy Corbyn, 56 percent of Labour appearances.
* Boris Johnson also dominated press coverage, accounting for 57 percent of Conservative appearances. In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn’s press profile only amounted to 28 percent of all Labour appearances.
* Television was more diverse that the press in terms of the range of political parties covered. For the press, the 2019 General Election was a two-horse race and other parties struggled to gain much coverage.
* That said, television news was more ‘presidentialised’ than the press, with the party leaders commanding a greater proportion of TV coverage relative to their party colleagues.
* By contrast, Labour by and large neglected Brexit, discussing it in less than 5 percent of its tweets. Labour focused predominantly on health (24.1 percent), the environment, and business.
* Besides Brexit, the Conservatives focused quite heavily on taxation (16.2 percent), which was relatively neglected by all the other parties.
* Unsurprisingly, the environment was by far the top issue for the Green Party (45.9 percent), and devolution was the key focus for the Scottish National Party (29.8 percent) and Plaid Cymru (21.4 percent).
* The Brexit Party was unique in its focus on defence and terrorism (14 percent), particularly in response to the attacks in London.
* Overall the results suggest that the main parties and their leaders fought remarkably different campaigns: the Conservatives, the LibDems, and the Brexit Party waged an all-out Brexit-centred campaign, while the other parties tried to shift the focus on the issues that they felt strongest on (the NHS for Labour, the environment for the Greens, and devolution for the SNP and Plaid).
* While the campaign has arguably been characterized by high levels of negativity, overall the tone of the parties’ tweets has been substantially more positive than negative.
* All parties were positive in their tweets at least half the time, with the Conservatives posting 75 percent positive tweets and the Brexit Party, Greens, and Plaid Cymru all posting 60 percent or more positive tweets.
* While Labour, the SNP and the LibDems also posted more positive than negative tweets, they were more likely than the other parties to attack their opponents.
* Nearly half (44.5 percent) of the tweets posted by the Lib-Dems were negative, compared to 39.4 percent for the SNP and 30.1 percent for Labour.
* By contrast, only 22.4 percent of the Conservatives’ tweets were negative, the smallest percentage among all the parties apart from the Greens (11.6 percent).
* The data show a clear difference between the campaigning style of the incumbent party, overwhelmingly focused on marshalling support for the Government and its Brexit deal, and the main challengers, who spent much more time and efforts attacking the Conservatives.
