1. Due to the size limitations both in Github and Learn, we submit JAMCS(0513).db for Python program testing.

2. Full project data is available at:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bFqsOdwFuYEpXJrkY89w-XqGcC9u8Zkv?usp=sharing

3. target.xlsx is the output from [part2_filter_cleaner.py] with database [JAMCS(0513).db]. 
So the outputs of [part3_data_process_visualization] won't be same as our report.

4. We have done tests for the whole program. If any problems happen, please contact: 
c.ke-19@student.lboro.ac.uk
Thank you!
