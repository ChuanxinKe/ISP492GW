1. Due to the size limitations both in Github and Learn, we submit JAMCS_0513.db for Python program tests.

2. Full project data is available at:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bFqsOdwFuYEpXJrkY89w-XqGcC9u8Zkv?usp=sharing

3. There is function to reminder all path configurations when starting. The scripts use relative paths.

4. target.xlsx is the output from [part2_filter_cleaner.py] with database [JAMCS_0513.db]. 
So the outputs of [part3_data_process_visualization] won't be same as our report, which used JAMCS.db in the links above.

5. We have done tests for the whole program. If any problems happen, please contact:

Thank you!
